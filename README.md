# AeroVision

AeroVision is a machine learning-based tool designed to predict airflow visualizations around 2D airfoil shapes without requiring physical smoke tests or expensive CFD simulations. Using a generative adversarial network (Pix2Pix), the model is trained to infer realistic smoke-flow patterns from input images of airfoils at known angles of attack. The goal is to provide a cost-effective, accessible alternative for aerodynamic visualization, particularly for educational and early-stage design purposes.
